# BCXGallery_Webpage
This is a simple website I designed as the end-of-quarter project for W2020 Intro to Web Design course @TESC
It is meant as a way to keep track of and display my drawings from the W2020 Body Drawing class, a sort of hit-two-birtds-with-one-stone sort of project, as the uncertainty of being able to have in-person evaluations due to Covid19 spread in the state loomed on the horizon.
